# DEPLOYMENT_READINESS.md

## Summary of Findings

This report details the changes made to prepare the `scan_send.py` application for production deployment. The application is a Python script that sends WhatsApp messages via the WhatsApp Business Cloud API, triggered by a GitHub Actions workflow.

**Key Changes Implemented:**

*   **Code Refinements (`scan_send.py`):**
    *   Improved error handling for missing environment variables, providing clearer instructions to the user.
    *   Modified handling of `TEMPLATE_NS` and `TEMPLATE_NM`: The script now uses placeholder values and issues a warning if these are not set, allowing it to run for debugging purposes instead of immediately exiting.
    *   Enhanced API request error handling, including catching more specific exceptions (`ConnectionError`, `Timeout`) and improving the parsing and display of error messages from the API.
    *   Added a 10-second timeout to the API request.
    *   Added more descriptive comments throughout the script for better maintainability.
    *   Refactored the main logic into a `main()` function to facilitate testability and cleaner execution flow.

*   **Workflow Enhancements (`.github/workflows/hourly-scout.yml`):**
    *   Added `TEMPLATE_NS` and `TEMPLATE_NM` to the environment variables sourced from GitHub secrets.
    *   Included a comment in the workflow file to guide users on setting up all required secrets.
    *   Updated the dependency installation step to use `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

*   **Dependency Management:**
    *   Created a `requirements.txt` file listing the `requests` dependency.

*   **Testing:**
    *   Added a comprehensive suite of unit tests (`tests/test_scan_send.py`) using the `unittest` framework.
    *   Tests cover environment variable handling, payload construction, successful API calls (mocked), and various API error conditions (mocked), including connection errors and timeouts.

## Confidence Score

**Confidence Score: 75/100**

**Reasoning:**

*   **Strengths:**
    *   The script itself is relatively small and its core logic has been reviewed and improved.
    *   Error handling for both environment configuration and API interactions has been significantly hardened.
    *   Unit tests cover the script's logic, payload generation, and expected responses to (mocked) API calls.
    *   The GitHub Actions workflow is updated to include all necessary environment variables (pending secret creation by the user).
    *   Dependency management is now explicit via `requirements.txt`.
*   **Areas for User Verification & Remaining Concerns:**
    *   **Secrets Configuration:** The deployment's success is critically dependent on the user correctly configuring the following secrets in GitHub: `PHONE_ID`, `WABA_TOKEN`, `USER_NUMBER`, `TEMPLATE_NS`, `TEMPLATE_NM`. Without these, the script will either fail or use placeholder template info.
    *   **Live API Testing:** The script has not been tested against the live WhatsApp API due to the lack of credentials. The unit tests rely on mocks. Real-world API behavior, rate limits, or authentication issues might only surface during live testing.
    *   **Template Validity:** The actual WhatsApp message template (identified by `TEMPLATE_NS` and `TEMPLATE_NM`) must exist, be approved by Meta, and match the parameter structure expected by `scan_send.py` (three text parameters for body).
    *   **GitHub Actions Runner Environment:** While `ubuntu-latest` is standard, any subtle differences in a live runner environment versus local/test environments are untested.
    *   **Security of Secrets:** While GitHub Secrets are generally secure, the user must ensure proper access controls to the repository and its settings.

## Test Results

*   **Unit Tests:**
    *   A suite of unit tests located in `tests/test_scan_send.py` was executed using `python -m unittest tests.test_scan_send`.
    *   All tests passed successfully in a simulated environment with mocked external dependencies (like `os.getenv` and `requests.post`).
    *   Coverage includes:
        *   Environment variable loading and validation.
        *   Default value assignments (e.g., `LANG_CODE`, placeholder templates).
        *   Correct construction of API request URL, headers, and payload.
        *   Handling of successful API responses.
        *   Handling of various API error codes and problematic responses (e.g., JSON errors, connection errors, timeouts).

*(Note: These tests do not involve actual calls to the WhatsApp API.)*

## Deployment Checklist

**Critical Pre-Deployment Steps:**

1.  [ ] **Configure GitHub Secrets:** Ensure the following secrets are accurately set up in your GitHub repository settings (Settings -> Secrets and variables -> Actions -> New repository secret):
    *   `PHONE_ID`: Your WhatsApp phone number ID.
    *   `WABA_TOKEN`: Your WhatsApp Business API permanent system user access token.
    *   `USER_NUMBER`: The recipient's phone number in E.164 format.
    *   `TEMPLATE_NS`: The namespace of your approved WhatsApp message template.
    *   `TEMPLATE_NM`: The name of your approved WhatsApp message template.

2.  [ ] **Verify WhatsApp Message Template:**
    *   Confirm that the message template identified by `TEMPLATE_NS` and `TEMPLATE_NM` is active and approved in your WhatsApp Business Manager.
    *   Ensure the template expects exactly three text parameters for the message body, corresponding to `headline`, `trade`, and `footer` in `scan_send.py`.

3.  [ ] **Review IAM/Access (If applicable):** If running in a self-hosted runner or with more complex cloud integrations, ensure the runner has appropriate permissions. (Less relevant for standard GitHub-hosted runners).

**Post-Deployment Monitoring:**

4.  [ ] **Monitor Initial GitHub Actions Runs:** Check the output of the `hourly-scout` workflow for the first few scheduled runs to ensure it completes successfully and messages are received.
5.  [ ] **Check for API Errors:** If runs fail, examine the workflow logs for any API error messages reported by `scan_send.py`.
6.  [ ] **Confirm Message Delivery:** Verify that test messages are being delivered to the `USER_NUMBER`.

## Remaining Concerns or TODOs

*   **Live Integration Test:** Perform a test with actual, valid (even if temporary/developer) WhatsApp API credentials and a test template to ensure end-to-end functionality. This is the most critical next step for full confidence.
*   **Alert Content Generation:** The script currently uses hardcoded example content for `headline`, `trade`, and `footer`. The comment `# (replace with real scanner output)` indicates that real-world usage would require integrating actual data generation. This aspect is outside the scope of the current review but essential for the application's intended purpose.
*   **Security Review of `WABA_TOKEN`:** Ensure the `WABA_TOKEN` is a "Permanent system-user access token" as stated in the script's comments and not a short-lived one. Ensure its permissions are scoped as narrowly as possible for sending messages.
